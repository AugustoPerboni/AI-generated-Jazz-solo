![jazz](https://github.com/AugustoPerboni/autogenerate-Jazz-solo-LSTM/assets/120643495/10386a55-563e-4f44-aff0-f00f625a5608)

The Jupyter notebook "Improvise_a_Jazz_Solo_with_an_LSTM_Network.ipynb" is a step-by-step guide on how to generate a Jazz solo with an LSTM network. By running the cells, you can listen to the input data and the final output generated by the model.
